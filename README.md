# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict cervical cancer risk based on patient data, specifically using machine learning algorithms for classification. The dataset typically includes various clinical features, such as age, hormonal therapy usage, number of pregnancies, smoking status.
**Objective:
To predict whether a patient is at risk for cervical cancer (positive or negative diagnosis) based on their medical history and other relevant features.

Steps Involved:
Data Collection:

The dataset contains features such as age, HPV test results, number of pregnancies, use of hormonal therapy, and smoking habits.
It is publicly available in various healthcare-related repositories, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of features (e.g., histograms, box plots) and perform correlation analysis to understand the relationships between variables.

Model Selection:

Choose machine learning models suitable for classification tasks, such as:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Model Training & Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
Train the models using the training data and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under Curve).
Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Compare model performance and select the best one based on evaluation metrics.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new patient data, providing a probability score for cervical cancer risk.
